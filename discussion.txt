Runtime
-------

1. Runtime for does_string_contain_letter:
constant


2. Runtime for duplicate_letters:
O(n^2)


3. Runtime for duplicate_letters2:
O(n)


Stacks and Queues
-----------------


1. Which would be a better data structure for creating a Stack: a Linked List or 
   a built-in Python list? Explain why, referencing the runtime requirements for
   Stack operations (push, pop, etc).

Linked list is better to use as a stack. Runtime is O(1). You can set up your linked list so that you're only allowed to remove or add items from the end of the list. 

2. Which would be a better data structure for creating a Queue: a Linked List or
   a built-in Python list? Explain why, referencing the runtime requirements for
   Queue methods (enqueue, dequeue, etc).

Linked list is better. A queue made with a doubly-linked list has a runtime of O(1) when adding or removing an item from the beginning or end of the list. A regular list has a runtime of O(n) when removing an item from the list. 

Trees
-----

1. Using the diagram in the instructions, in what order would a Breadth First
   Search (BFS) algorithm visit each node  until finding burritos (starting at
   food)?

[food]
[Italian, Indian, Mexican]
[Indian, Mexican, Lasagna, pizza]
[Mexican, lasagna, pizza, tikka Masala, saag]
[lasagna, pizza, tikka tasala, saag, burritos, tacos, enchilads]
[pizza, tikka masala, saag, burritos, tacos, enchilads]
[tikka masala, saag, burritos, tacos, enchilads, thin crust, Chicago-style, New York-style, Sicilian]
[saag, burritos, tacos, enchilads, thin crust, Chicago-style, New York-style, Sicilian]
[burritos, tacos, enchilads, thin crust, Chicago-style, New York-style, Sicilian]
pop(burritos)!!!

2. Using the diagram in the instructions, In what order would a Depth First 
   Search (DFS) algorithm visit each node until finding Chicago-style (starting
   at food)? 

[food]
[Italian, Indian, Mexican]
[Italian, Indian, burritos, tacos]
[Italian, Indian, burritos]
[Italian, Indian]
[Italian, tikka masala, saag]
[Italian, tikka masala]
[Italian]
[lasagna, pizza]
[lasagna, thin crust, Chicago-style, New York-style, Sicilian]
[lasagna, thin crust, Chicago-style, New York-style]
[lasagna, thin crust, Chicago-style]
pop(Chicago-style)!!!

3. How is a binary search tree different from other trees?

Binary search trees have a left and right nodes instead of single to multiple children.
